                <h3>RSSTV</h3>
                <p>RSSTV is a high-performace slow-scan television transcoder for amateur radio operators featuring multiple stagees of narrow filtering to deliver the best noise performance. This project involved optimising tight-looped code and memory use across millions of samples which all needed to be processed into an image. This project has also been compiled to the web - check the navbar for more</p>

                <h3>Fox-hunting PCB</h3>
                <p>This PCB features a high-performace receiver and transmitter to function on a single unit, allowing people who host and go to amateur radio events to do so easily and cheaply with a single unit, as opposed to two with other products.</p>
